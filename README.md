I'm Peyton Curr. Currently I am a full-stack web developer and graduate of Boise CodeWorks. I also have a professional background in Technical Support & System integration/ administration. 

Ever since I can remember, I have always had a passion for logical problem solving. I first learned my passion for logical problem solving would align itself perfectly with the world of computer science after taking my first intro to C++ class at SaddleBack Community College. I continued diving into this discovery by going on to study Computer Science at Boise State University, and by jumping into a full-stack web development bootcamp, where in a stressful and fast paced environment I learned to become a skilled full-stack developer.
